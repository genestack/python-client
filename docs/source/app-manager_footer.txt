Removing all of your applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- If you want to remove all your applications, you can use the following bash script::

    for A in $(genestack-application-manager applications); do
        for V in $(genestack-application-manager versions -o $A); do
            genestack-application-manager remove $V $A
        done
    done

- And if you want to remove only those your applications that were loaded from a specific JAR file, then::

    JAR=path/to/file.jar
    for A in $(genestack-application-manager info $JAR | tail -n+3); do
        for V in $(genestack-application-manager versions -o $A); do
            genestack-application-manager remove $V $A
        done
    done

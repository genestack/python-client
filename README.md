### Generate docs

 - install sphinx http://sphinx-doc.org/
 - `cd docs`
 - `make html`

 **Note!** Make docs use script `make_shell_docs.py` that generates documentation files for shell scripts(genestack-user-setup.rst, genestack-application-manager.rst). 
 app-manager_usage.rst is not included to index, it is required for `make_shell_docs.py`
